# pDMET: Density matrix embedding theory for periodic systems 
A Python code to perform density matrix embedding theory calculations for periodic system.
pDMET can compute the ground-state energy as well as the quasiparticle band structure of solids.

- Cmake 2.8 or higher
- Python 3.5 or higher
- Numby 1.8.0 or higher
- Scipy 0.10 or higher 
- wannier90 and pyWannier90 library 

# Current function
- One-shot and self-consistent pDMET calculation
- Computing electronic band structure

# Future function
- MPI for Fast Fourier transform for ERI
- Excited state and spin systems
